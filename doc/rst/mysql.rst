Connecting AMPL to MySQL
========================

To use MySQL with AMPL, you need to have the MySQL ODBC driver, also known as
`Connector/ODBC <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-odbc.html>`__,
installed and to have access to a database server, which could be either
local or remote. You can download the latest version of the MySQL ODBC driver
for various platforms from `<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/>`__.

Installation
------------

GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~

Debian-based distributions
``````````````````````````

The following instructions apply to `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`__
and Debian-based Linux distributions such as `Ubuntu
<https://www.ubuntu.com/>`__ and `Mint <https://linuxmint.com/>`__.

#. Install the MySQL ODBC driver:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install libmyodbc

#. Register the driver:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo odbcinst -i -d -f /usr/share/libmyodbc/odbcinst.ini

Go to :ref:`mysql-usage`.

SUSE Linux
``````````

#. Install the MySQL ODBC driver:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo zypper install MyODBC-unixODBC

#. Register the ODBC driver. The easiest way to register the driver
   is by using the ``myodbc-installer`` utility included in the
   ``MyODBC-unixODBC`` package, for example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo myodbc-installer -d -a -n "MySQL" \
          -t "DRIVER=/usr/lib/libmyodbc5.so"

   ``/usr/lib/libmyodbc5.so`` is the path to the driver library
   that you installed in the previous step. You might need to change it
   if you have a different version of the driver.

   Note that the MySQL ODBC/Connector distribution does not include a
   setup library. If you invoke ``myodbc-installer --help``, you may see an
   outdated example with a ``SETUP`` attribute specifying a setup library.
   Omit this attribute during the driver registration unless you have
   installed a setup library from some other source.

Go to :ref:`mysql-usage`.

Other distributions
```````````````````

#. Install `unixODBC <https://www.unixodbc.org>`__ following `these instructions
   <https://www.unixodbc.org/download.html>`__.

#. Install the MySQL Connector/ODBC following `these instructions
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-odbc-installation.html#connector-odbc-installation-binary-unix>`__.
   Make sure that you use compatible versions of the ODBC driver
   (Connector/ODBC) and the MySQL client library, otherwise the driver
   library will not load and any connection attempt will fail.

#. Register the ODBC driver. The easiest way to register the driver is
   by using the ``myodbc-installer`` utility included in the distribution,
   for example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo myodbc-installer -d -a -n "MySQL" \
          -t "DRIVER=/usr/local/lib/libmyodbc5a.so"

   ``/usr/local/lib/libmyodbc5a.so`` is the path to the driver library
   that you installed in the previous step. You might need to change it
   if you have a different version of the driver or installed it in a
   different location. See the name of the ``.so`` file in the ``lib``
   directory of the installation package.

   Note that the MySQL ODBC/Connector distribution does not include a
   setup library. If you invoke ``myodbc-installer --help``, you may see an
   outdated example with a ``SETUP`` attribute specifying a setup library.
   Omit this attribute during the driver registration unless you have
   installed a setup library from some other source.

Go to :ref:`mysql-usage`.

MacOS X
~~~~~~~

The easiest way to install the MySQL ODBC driver on Mac is by using an
installer available for download as a DMG archive from the
`Connector/ODBC download page on the MySQL website
<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/#downloads>`__.

Alternatively you can install the MySQL Connector/ODBC as described `here
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-odbc-installation.html#connector-odbc-installation-binary-macosx>`__,
skipping the outdated last step (driver registration) and then register
the driver with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo myodbc-installer -d -a -n "MySQL" \
       -t "DRIVER=/usr/local/lib/libmyodbc5w.so"

``/usr/local/lib/libmyodbc5w.so`` is the path to the driver library
that you installed in the previous step. You might need to change it
if you have a different version of the driver or installed it in a
different location. See the name of the ``.so`` file in the ``lib``
directory of the installation package.

Note that the MySQL ODBC/Connector distribution does not include a
setup library. If you invoke ``myodbc-installer --help``, you may see an
outdated example with a ``SETUP`` attribute specifying a setup library.
Omit this attribute during the driver registration unless you have
installed a setup library from some other source.

Go to :ref:`mysql-usage`.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Install and register the MySQL Connector/ODBC following `these instructions
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-odbc-installation.html#connector-odbc-installation-binary-windows>`__.

.. _mysql-usage:

Usage
-----

We'll demonstrate usage of MySQL with AMPL on a small example.
For this example we use the diet problem, which finds a combination of foods
that satisfies certain nutritional requirements. It is described in
`Chapter 2 of the AMPL book <https://www.ampl.com/BOOK/CHAPTERS/05-tut2.pdf>`__.

We assume that you've already installed the MySQL ODBC driver using
the instructions above and have access to the MySQL ``test`` database.

First download the data for the diet problem `diet-mysql.sql
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet-mysql.sql>`__
and import it to MySQL:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mysql test < diet-mysql.sql

Then download the model file `diet.mod
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet.mod>`__
and the script file `diet-mysql.run
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet-mysql.run>`__.

The script file first reads the model:

.. code-block:: none

   model diet.mod;

Then it defines a parameter to hold a connection string. Since the connection
parameters are the same for all table declarations in our example, we
avoid unnecessary duplication. In this case we specify all the connection
parameters explicitly. Alternatively, you could use a DSN file name or
``"DSN=<dsn-name>"`` as a connection string.

.. code-block:: none

   param ConnectionStr symbolic = "DRIVER=MySQL; DATABASE=test;";

If you are using Linux or MacOS X and have chosen a driver name other
than ``MySQL``, you will have to specify this name instead of ``MySQL``
in the ``DRIVER=MySQL`` attribute in the connection string.

A driver name is chosen automatically during installation on Windows,
so if you are using this OS, you will have to find the driver name and
specify it instead of ``MySQL`` in the connection string.
To discover the driver name on Windows, run the ODBC Data Source
Administrator, ``odbcad32.exe``.  Go to the ``Drivers`` tab where all the
installed drivers are listed and look for the one containing ``MySQL``:

.. image:: /img/odbcad32.png

A driver name containing a semicolon (``;``) should be surrounded with
``{`` and ``}`` in a connection string, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   param ConnectionStr symbolic =
     "DRIVER={MySQL ODBC Driver; version 5.2}; DATABASE=test;";

Next there are several table declarations that use the ``ConnectionStr``
parameter defined previously:

.. code-block:: none

   table dietFoods "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Foods":
      FOOD <- [FOOD], cost IN, f_min IN, f_max IN,
      Buy OUT, Buy.rc ~ BuyRC OUT, {j in FOOD} Buy[j]/f_max[j] ~ BuyFrac;

   table dietNutrs IN "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Nutrients": NUTR <- [NUTR], n_min, n_max;
   table dietAmts IN "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Amounts": [NUTR, FOOD], amt;

Finally the script reads the data from the tables

.. code-block:: none

   read table dietFoods;
   read table dietNutrs;
   read table dietAmts;

solves the problem
                  
.. code-block:: none

   solve;

and writes the solution back to the database:

.. code-block:: none

   write table dietFoods;

Note that the same table ``dietFoods`` is used both for input and output.

Running the ``diet-mysql.run`` script with ampl shows that data connection
is working properly and the problem is easily solved:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ampl diet-mysql.run
   MINOS 5.51: optimal solution found.
   13 iterations, objective 118.0594032

You can use various database tools such as `MySQL workbench
<https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/>`__ or `MySQL command-line tool
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql.html>`__ to view the data
exported to the database from the AMPL script:

.. image:: ../img/mysql-workbench.png

SQL statements
--------------

The default `identifier quote character in MySQL
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifiers.html>`__
is the backquote (`````). AMPL's ODBC table handler detects the quote
character automatically and uses it when necessary. However,
user-supplied SQL statements are passed to the MySQL ODBC driver as is
and should use the correct quotation. It is possible to enable support for
the ANSI standard quote character (``"``) in MySQL by setting the SQL mode to
`ANSI_QUOTES
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html#sqlmode_ansi_quotes>`__.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC" "DRIVER=MySQL; DATABASE=test;"
      "SQL=SELECT `FOOD`, `cost` FROM `Foods`;": [FOOD], cost;

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section lists common problems with possible solutions.

The first thing to do in case of an error is to get additional information.
Add the option ``"verbose"`` to the table declaration that causes the error,
for example:

.. code-block:: none

   table dietFoods "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Foods" "verbose":
     ...

Then rerun your code and you should get a more detailed error message.

Data source name not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbose error:

.. code-block:: none

   SQLDriverConnect returned -1
   sqlstate = "IM002"
   errmsg = "[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name not found, and no default driver specified"
   native_errno = 0

If the data source name (DSN) was not found as in the example above check 
if it is spelled correctly in the connection string. If you are not using a
DSN, check the driver name instead. On a Unix-based system you can get the
list of installed ODBC drivers using one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ myodbc-installer -d -l

.. code-block:: bash

   $ odbcinst -d -q

On Windows use the ODBC Data Source Administrator (see :ref:`mysql-usage`).

If the driver name contains a semicolon (``;``), check that the name is
surrounded with ``{`` and ``}`` in the connection string, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC" "DRIVER={MySQL ODBC Driver; version 5.2}; DATABASE=test;":
     ...

Can't connect through socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbose error:

.. code-block:: none

   SQLDriverConnect returned -1
   sqlstate = "08S01"
   errmsg = "[unixODBC][MySQL][ODBC 5.2(a) Driver]Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)"
   native_errno = 2002

First check that the MySQL server is running. If it is running then
it is likely that the Unix socket file that is used for communication
between the server and the client is in a different location.
To find the location of the socket file open ``/etc/my.cnf`` or
``/etc/mysql/my.cnf`` and search for lines of the form

.. code-block:: none

   [mysqld]
   ...
   socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

The ``socket = <path>`` line specifies the path to the socket file.
You can either create a link from ``/tmp/mysql.sock`` to the socket file
or specify the socket explicitly in the connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC"
     "DRIVER=MySQL; DATABASE=test; SOCKET=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock;":
      ...
