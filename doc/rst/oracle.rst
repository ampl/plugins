Connecting AMPL to Oracle
=========================

To use Oracle with AMPL, you need to have the `Oracle ODBC driver
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/index-098976.html>`__
installed and to have access to a database server, which could be either
local or remote.

Installation
------------

GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~

Debian-based distributions
``````````````````````````

The following instructions apply to `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`__
and Debian-based Linux distributions such as `Ubuntu
<https://www.ubuntu.com/>`__ and `Mint <https://linuxmint.com/>`__.

#. Download RPM packages of Oracle Instant Client for your Linux platform from the
   `Instant Client Downloads page
   <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html>`__.
   You will need the Basic and ODBC packages. In the Usage example we also use ``sqlplus`` from
   the SQL*Plus package.

#. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install alien libaio1 unixodbc-dev

#. Convert packages from RPM to DEB format:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo alien oracle-instantclient*.rpm
   
#. Install the packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo dpkg -i oracle-instantclient*.deb

#. Add the Oracle library directory to the library search paths:

   .. code-block:: bash

      echo /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*/lib | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf
      sudo ldconfig

#. Register the ODBC driver:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo /usr/share/oracle/*/client*/odbc_update_ini.sh / /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*/lib

#. Create a symbolic link for ``libodbcinst.so`` on ``x86-64``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libodbcinst.so \
                 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libodbcinst.so.2

   Use the following command with the ``x86`` version instead:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libodbcinst.so \
                 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libodbcinst.so.2

#. Set the ``ORACLE_HOME`` environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export ORACLE_HOME=<installation-dir>

   replacing ``<installation-dir>`` with the actual installation directory, which can
   be printed with the command ``echo /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*``.

   Alternatively you can add the line ``ORACLE_HOME=<installation-dir>`` to
   ``~/.pam_environment`` to set this environment variable permanently for
   the current user. Use ``/etc/environment`` instead of ``~/.pam_environment``
   for system-wide environment variables.
   See also `Persistent environment variables
   <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Persistent_environment_variables>`__.

Other distributions
```````````````````

#. Install `unixODBC <https://www.unixodbc.org>`__ following `these instructions
   <https://www.unixodbc.org/download.html>`__.

#. Download and install Oracle Instant Client packages for your Linux platform from the
   `Instant Client Downloads page
   <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html>`__.
   You will need the Basic and ODBC packages. In the Usage example we also use ``sqlplus`` from
   the SQL*Plus package.

#. Add the Oracle library directory to the library search paths:

   .. code-block:: bash

      echo /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*/lib | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf
      sudo /sbin/ldconfig

#. If the files ``odbc.ini`` and ``odbcinst.ini`` are located in
   ``/etc/unixODBC`` instead of ``/etc`` create symbolic links:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -s /etc/unixODBC/odbc.ini /etc/odbc.ini
      sudo ln -s /etc/unixODBC/odbcinst.ini /etc/odbcinst.ini

#. Register the ODBC driver:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo /usr/share/oracle/*/client*/odbc_update_ini.sh / /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*/lib

#. If ``/usr/lib/libodbc.so.1`` doesn't exist create a symbolic link

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libodbc.so.2 /usr/lib/libodbc.so.1
      
#. Set the ``ORACLE_HOME`` environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export ORACLE_HOME=<installation-dir>

   replacing ``<installation-dir>`` with the actual installation directory, which can
   be printed with the command ``echo /usr/lib/oracle/*/client*``.

   Alternatively you can add the line ``ORACLE_HOME=<installation-dir>`` to
   ``~/.pam_environment`` or to ``~/.bashrc`` (depending on your distribution)
   to set this environment variable permanently for the current user.
   Use ``/etc/environment`` for system-wide environment variables.
   See also `Persistent environment variables
   <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Persistent_environment_variables>`__.

MacOS X
~~~~~~~

Oracle doesn't provide ODBC drivers for Mac OS X but you can get them from
third-party companies such as `OpenLink Software <https://www.openlinksw.com/>`__.

Go to :ref:`oracle-usage`.

Windows
~~~~~~~

The ODBC driver for Oracle often comes installed by default on modern versions
of Windows. You can check if the driver is installed by running the ODBC Data Source
Administrator, ``odbcad32.exe``, and looking for Oracle in the ``Drivers`` tab.

.. image:: /img/odbcad32-oracle.png

If the driver is missing, download one from `OracleODBC Drivers Download Page
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/downloads/index-096177.html>`__
(32-bit version) and install it. 64-bit version of the driver is available as
a part of `Oracle Data Access Components
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/downloads/index-090165.html>`__.

.. _oracle-usage:

Usage
-----

We'll demonstrate usage of Oracle with AMPL on a small example.
For this example we use the diet problem, which finds a combination of foods
that satisfies certain nutritional requirements. It is described in
`Chapter 2 of the AMPL book <https://www.ampl.com/BOOK/CHAPTERS/05-tut2.pdf>`__.

We assume that you've already installed the Oracle ODBC driver using
the instructions above and have access to a local Oracle database.

First download the data for the diet problem `diet-oracle.sql
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet-oracle.sql>`__
and import it into an Oracle database:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sqlplus <username>/<password> @diet-oracle.sql

where ``<username>`` is the name of a database user and ``<password>`` is the
user's password.
 
Then download the model file `diet.mod
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet.mod>`__
and the script file `diet-oracle.run
<https://ampl.github.io/models/tables/diet-oracle.run>`__.

The script file first reads the model:

.. code-block:: none

   model diet.mod;

Then it defines a parameter to hold a connection string. Since the connection
parameters are the same for all table declarations in our example, we
avoid unnecessary duplication. In this case we specify all the connection
parameters explicitly. Alternatively, you could use a DSN file name or
``"DSN=<dsn-name>"`` as a connection string.

.. code-block:: none

   param ConnectionStr symbolic = "DRIVER=Oracle; SERVER=localhost;";

Replace ``Oracle`` with the actual driver name in the connection string above.

To find out the driver name on Linux, run the command ``odbcinst -q -d`` to
display the names of installed ODBC drivers on Linux

.. code-block:: bash

   $ odbcinst -q -d
   [SQLite3]
   [Oracle 12c ODBC driver]

and select the one containing ``Oracle``. In the example above it is
``Oracle 12c ODBC driver``. Note that the square brackets are not part of the name.

To discover the driver name on Windows, run the ODBC Data Source
Administrator, ``odbcad32.exe``.  Go to the ``Drivers`` tab where all the
installed drivers are listed and look for the one containing ``Oracle``:

.. image:: /img/odbcad32-oracle.png

A driver name containing a semicolon (``;``) should be surrounded with
``{`` and ``}`` in a connection string, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   param ConnectionStr symbolic =
     "DRIVER={Oracle ODBC Driver; version 6.01}; SERVER=localhost;";

Next there are several table declarations that use the ``ConnectionStr``
parameter defined previously:

.. code-block:: none

   table dietFoods "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Foods":
       FOOD <- [FOOD], cost IN, f_min IN, f_max IN,
       Buy OUT, Buy.rc ~ BuyRC OUT, {j in FOOD} Buy[j]/f_max[j] ~ BuyFrac;

   table dietNutrs IN "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Nutrients": NUTR <- [NUTR], n_min, n_max;
   table dietAmts IN "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Amounts": [NUTR, FOOD], amt;

Finally the script reads the data from the tables

.. code-block:: none

   read table dietFoods;
   read table dietNutrs;
   read table dietAmts;

solves the problem
                  
.. code-block:: none

   solve;

and writes the solution back to the database:

.. code-block:: none

   write table dietFoods;

Note that the same table ``dietFoods`` is used both for input and output.

Running the ``diet-oracle.run`` script with ampl shows that data connection
is working properly and the problem is easily solved:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ampl diet-oracle.run
   MINOS 5.51: optimal solution found.
   13 iterations, objective 118.0594032

You can use various database tools such as `Oracle SQL Developer IDE
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html>`__,
`Oracle Application Express
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/overview/index.html>`__,
or `sqlplus <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/toc.htm>`__
to view the data exported to the database from the AMPL script:

.. image:: /img/oracle-application-express.png

SQL statements
--------------

The identifier quote character in Oracle the ANSI standard quote character (``"``).
AMPL's ODBC table handler detects the quote character automatically and uses it
when necessary. However, user-supplied SQL statements are passed to the Oracle ODBC
driver as is and should use the correct quotation.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC" "DRIVER=Oracle; SERVER=localhost;"
     'SQL=SELECT "FOOD", "cost" FROM "Foods";': [FOOD], cost;

DSN Example
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows a DSN entry in the ``odbc.ini`` file that
can be used to connect to a remote Oracle Express Edition (XE) database:

.. code-block:: none

   [Diet]
   Driver       = Oracle 12c ODBC driver
   ServerName   = <server-ip-or-hostname>
   Database     = XE
   DSN          = Diet
   Port         = 1521
   UserID       = <username>
   Password     = <password>

The DSN can be used in an AMPL table declaration as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC" "DSN=Diet;": ...

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section lists common problems with possible solutions.

The first thing to do in case of an error is to get additional information.
Add the option ``"verbose"`` to the table declaration that causes the error,
for example:

.. code-block:: none

   table dietFoods "ODBC" (ConnectionStr) "Foods" "verbose":
     ...

Then rerun your code and you should get a more detailed error message.

Data source name not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbose error:

.. code-block:: none

   SQLDriverConnect returned -1
   sqlstate = "IM002"
   errmsg = "[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name not found, and no default driver specified"
   native_errno = 0

If the data source name (DSN) was not found as in the example above, check 
if it is spelled correctly in the connection string. If you are not using a
DSN, check the driver name instead. On a Unix-based system you can get the
list of installed ODBC drivers using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ odbcinst -d -q

On Windows use the ODBC Data Source Administrator (see :ref:`oracle-usage`).

If the driver name contains a semicolon (``;``), check that the name is
surrounded with ``{`` and ``}`` in the connection string, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   table Foods "ODBC" "DRIVER={Oracle ODBC Driver; version 6.01}; DATABASE=test;":
     ...

Driver's SQLAllocHandle on SQL_HANDLE_HENV failed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbose error:

.. code-block:: none

   SQLDriverConnect returned -1
   sqlstate = "IM004"
   errmsg = "[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Driver's SQLAllocHandle on SQL_HANDLE_HENV failed"
   native_errno = 0

This error may occur if the ``ORACLE_HOME`` environment variable is not set.

OID generation failed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``sqlplus`` prints the following error message:

.. code-block:: none

   ORA-21561: OID generation failed

Make sure your hostname and the name associated with IP address 127.0.1.1 in ``/etc/hosts``
are the same:

.. code-block:: none

   $ hostname
   your-machine
   $ grep 127.0.1.1 /etc/hosts
   127.0.1.1	your-machine
