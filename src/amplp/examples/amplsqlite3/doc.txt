A table handler for sqlite3 databases.

General information on table handlers and data correspondence between AMPL and 
an external table is available at chapter 10 of the AMPL book:

    https://ampl.com/learn/ampl-book/

Information on sqlite3 is available at

    https://www.sqlite.org

The available options for amplsqlite3 are:

alias:
    Instead of writing the data to the table with the name defined in the table
    declaration it's possible define the table name with an alias. In the
    following example the table handler will search for a table named "bar"
    instead of a table named "foo" as in the table declaration.

    Example:
        table foo OUT "amplsqlite3" "bar": [A], B;

external-table-spec:
    Specifies the path to the .db file to be read or written with the read 
    table and write table commands. If no file is specified, amplsqlite3 will
    search for a file with the table name and the .db file extension in the
    current directory. If the table is to be written and the file does not exist
    it will be created.

    Example:
        table foo OUT "amplsqlite3" "bar.db": [keycol], valcol;

verbose:
    Display warnings during the execution of the read table and write table
    commands.

    Example:
        table foo OUT "amplsqlite3" "verbose": [keycol], valcol;

verbose=option:
    Display information according to the specified option. Available options:
        0 (default) - display information only on error,
        1 - display warnings,
        2 - display general information
        3 - display debug information.

    Example:
        table foo OUT "amplsqlite3" "verbose=2": [keycol], valcol;

write=option
    Define how the data is written in OUT mode. Available options:
        delete (default) - deletes all the rows of the corresponding table (if
        it exists) before writing the data from AMPL.
        drop - drops the corresponding table and creates a new one.

    Example:
        table foo OUT "amplsqlite3" "write=drop": [keycol], valcol;
